# First, download the Laravel installer using Composer:
composer global require "laravel/installer"

#or, 
composer global require "laravel/installer=1.1"


# export path
``
nano ~/.bashrc
``


# add this line at the end of the file
``
export PATH="~/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH" 
``

# exit nano & save the file 


# Then reload path config
``
source ~/.bashrc
``

or 
``
export PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
``

# now we can create laravel application with following comman: 
``
laravel new 'path/to/project/name'
``




or, we can download and create laravel project each time by following command: 
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel 'path/to/project'

# or, 
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel 'path/to/project' {version}
